## Description
I developed an e-commerce platform focused on selling video game consoles. The main goal is to offer users a smooth and attractive shopping experience, with access to a wide variety of consoles, detailed information about each product, and an easy and intuitive purchase process, using React to build a modern and responsive interface. I also implemented key functionalities such as product management, shopping cart, and payment simulation, integrating good development practices and state management.
